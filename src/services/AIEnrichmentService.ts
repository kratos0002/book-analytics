      'crime and punishment': `"Crime and Punishment" is a seminal work of psychological realism and moral philosophy, widely regarded as one of the greatest novels ever written. Through the story of Raskolnikov, a tormented former student who murders an unscrupulous pawnbroker, Dostoevsky explores profound themes of guilt, redemption, and the human capacity for both cruelty and compassion. The novel brilliantly delves into the psychology of crime, examining how rationalization of immoral acts leads to spiritual and psychological suffering. Dostoevsky masterfully portrays the mental anguish and philosophical conflicts of his protagonist while weaving a complex narrative that functions both as a gripping crime thriller and a deep philosophical meditation on morality in an increasingly secular society. The novel's enduring significance lies in its unflinching examination of the human condition, the consequences of nihilism, and the possibility of spiritual renewal even after committing terrible acts.`,
      
      'war and peace': `"War and Peace" is Leo Tolstoy's monumental examination of early 19th-century Russian society during the Napoleonic Wars. The novel interweaves the stories of five aristocratic families against the backdrop of historical events, creating an unparalleled tapestry of human experience. Tolstoy brilliantly moves between intimate domestic scenes and grand historical movements, exploring how individuals both shape and are shaped by larger historical forces. The novel's extraordinary scope encompasses themes of free will versus determinism, the search for meaning in life, the nature of power, and the contrast between authentic living and societal expectations. Through characters like Pierre Bezukhov, Natasha Rostova, and Prince Andrei, Tolstoy examines the transformative power of love, suffering, and spiritual awakening. "War and Peace" remains a towering achievement in world literature for its psychological depth, philosophical insights, and its profound understanding of history as the collective actions of individuals rather than the will of "great men."`,
      
      'pride and prejudice': `"Pride and Prejudice" is Jane Austen's masterful examination of social manners, marriage, and the limitations placed on women in early 19th-century England. Through the witty and independent Elizabeth Bennet and the proud Mr. Darcy, Austen crafts a love story that transcends its romantic plot to offer sharp social criticism and psychological insight. The novel brilliantly explores how personal growth comes through recognizing one's own flaws and prejudices. Elizabeth must overcome her quick judgments, while Darcy must humble himself and shed his class-based pride. Beyond the central romance, Austen presents a cast of memorable characters and various marriage models that reflect different social values of the era. The novel's enduring appeal stems from its perfect balance of comedy and serious moral reflection, its sparkling dialogue, and its nuanced portrayal of human relationships. Austen's keen observations about social status, economic pressure, and female autonomy remain remarkably relevant today, making this work both a product of its time and timelessly perceptive about human nature.`,
      
      'brothers karamazov': `"The Brothers Karamazov" is Fyodor Dostoevsky's culminating masterpiece, widely considered one of the greatest achievements in world literature. This profound philosophical novel explores the complex relationships between faith, doubt, reason, and morality through the story of the Karamazov family. At its center are three brothers—the intellectual Ivan, the sensual Dmitri, and the spiritual Alyosha—whose differing worldviews represent competing ideological forces in 19th-century Russia. The novel's murder mystery framework serves as a vehicle for deep explorations of theology, epistemology, and ethics. Dostoevsky brilliantly examines the existential question of God's existence, the problem of evil, and human freedom through characters who embody various philosophical positions. The novel's richness lies in its refusal to provide simple answers, instead presenting a complex dialectic where faith and doubt, reason and passion, selfishness and love continuously engage in dialogue. Through the character of the Grand Inquisitor and Ivan's rebellion against divine justice, Dostoevsky created some of literature's most profound meditations on human suffering and the desire for meaning. The Brothers Karamazov stands as the culmination of Dostoevsky's literary genius, demonstrating his unparalleled psychological insight and his ability to infuse dramatic narrative with philosophical depth.`,

        aiAnalysis: `"The Brothers Karamazov" is Fyodor Dostoevsky's culminating masterpiece, widely considered one of the greatest achievements in world literature. This profound philosophical novel explores the complex relationships between faith, doubt, reason, and morality through the story of the Karamazov family. At its center are three brothers—the intellectual Ivan, the sensual Dmitri, and the spiritual Alyosha—whose differing worldviews represent competing ideological forces in 19th-century Russia. The novel's murder mystery framework serves as a vehicle for deep explorations of theology, epistemology, and ethics. Dostoevsky brilliantly examines the existential question of God's existence, the problem of evil, and human freedom through characters who embody various philosophical positions. The novel's richness lies in its refusal to provide simple answers, instead presenting a complex dialectic where faith and doubt, reason and passion, selfishness and love continuously engage in dialogue. Through the character of the Grand Inquisitor and Ivan's rebellion against divine justice, Dostoevsky created some of literature's most profound meditations on human suffering and the desire for meaning. The Brothers Karamazov stands as the culmination of Dostoevsky's literary genius, demonstrating his unparalleled psychological insight and his ability to infuse dramatic narrative with philosophical depth.`
